# Implementation Patterns

<!-- Requires: docs/DESIGN.md must be populated first -->

## Code Organization
<!-- Module structure, file naming, directory layout conventions -->
<!-- How the src/ package is organized and why -->

## Design Patterns
<!-- Patterns in use (repository, factory, strategy, etc.) and where they apply -->
<!-- Include brief rationale for each pattern choice -->

## Error Handling
<!-- How errors are represented, propagated, and reported -->
<!-- Exception hierarchy, error codes, logging conventions -->

## Testing Patterns
<!-- Test structure, fixture conventions, what to test vs skip -->
<!-- Naming conventions, assertion style, test data management -->
