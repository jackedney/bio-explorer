# Project Specification

## Purpose
<!-- What problem does this project solve? What is its core mission? -->
<!-- Keep this abstract — no mention of specific tools, libraries, or patterns -->

## Requirements
<!-- List each requirement as a clear, testable statement -->
<!-- Example: "The system must authenticate users before granting access" -->
<!-- NOT: "Use JWT tokens for authentication" (that's a DESIGN decision) -->

## Constraints
<!-- Non-negotiable boundaries: performance targets, compatibility, regulations -->

## Out of Scope
<!-- Explicitly list what this project does NOT do -->
