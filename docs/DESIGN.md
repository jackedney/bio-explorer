# Design Document

<!-- Requires: docs/SPEC.md must be populated first -->

## Architecture
<!-- High-level system structure. Components and how they connect. -->
<!-- Reference which SPEC requirements drive these architectural choices. -->

## Technology Choices
<!-- Chosen packages/frameworks and WHY they were chosen -->
<!-- For each choice, reference which SPEC requirement it serves -->
<!-- Example: -->
<!-- | Package | Purpose | Serves Requirement | -->
<!-- |---------|---------|-------------------| -->
<!-- | FastAPI  | HTTP API framework | "Must expose REST endpoints" | -->

## Interfaces
<!-- API boundaries, data formats, protocols between components -->
<!-- Define inputs, outputs, and contracts — no implementation details -->

## Key Decisions
<!-- Decisions that required research or trade-off analysis -->
<!-- For each: decision made, alternatives considered, rationale for choice -->
